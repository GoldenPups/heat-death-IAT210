            <p>The universe is dyingâ€¦</p>
            <p>Stars are fading, life sustaining energy is disappearing. Civilizations from all around the universe, some old and strong, other brand new and forming. But, the universe does not wait for anyone, everyone has been forced to fight for survival. The era has been called <span style={{color : "red", fontWeight: 700}}>HEAT DEATH.</span></p>
            <p>The last resources are squeezed from planets and stars. Type II civilizations create dyson spheres and drill sites to obtain every single last drop of minerals, and energy. But space is no longer endless as planets and stars die, and resources vanish, civilizations come closer together. What once was peaceful exploration has been turned into fear and conquest. Any trust that was there is now treachery.</p>
            <p>Armies are formed, alliances are made, betrayed, and destroyed. But alas, the only goal is to be the last one standing, by any means. You have to watch your back as anything or anyone can kill you. Not just other people, but cosmic disasters, what once was a safe path may never be safe again. Only one civilization will survive this era. You must outbuild, outbuild, and outfight the rest. In this dying universe, this cold and scary place, domination is the only hope to survive Heat Death.</p>
